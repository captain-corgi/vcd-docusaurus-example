## Current Threat Landscape

Our cybersecurity team has identified several sophisticated phishing campaigns targeting financial institutions. These attacks are specifically designed to appear as legitimate communications from:

- Federal regulatory agencies (FDIC, Federal Reserve)
- Software vendors (core banking systems, compliance tools)
- Internal IT communications
- Customer service requests

## Common Attack Patterns

### 1. Regulatory Compliance Emails

**What to Look For**:

- Urgent requests for compliance documentation
- Threats of regulatory action for non-compliance
- Requests to click links to "verify" information
- Suspicious sender addresses (e.g., fdic-compliance&#64;gmail.com)

:::warning Example Phishing Email

**Subject**: "URGENT: FDIC Compliance Verification Required"

**From**: fdic-compliance&#64;regulatory-update.com

**Content**: "Your institution must verify compliance status within 24 hours or face penalties. Click here to access the verification portal."

**Red Flags**:

- Non-official domain
- Urgent language
- Generic greeting
- Suspicious link

:::

### 2. System Update Notifications

**What to Look For**:

- Fake software update notifications
- Requests for login credentials
- Links to download "security patches"
- Impersonation of IT support

### 3. Customer Service Impersonation

**What to Look For**:

- Emails claiming to be from customers
- Requests to process urgent transactions
- Attachments containing "account information"
- Pressure to bypass normal verification procedures

## Immediate Actions Required

### For All Staff

1. **Verify Before You Click**
   - Always verify sender identity through official channels
   - Never click links in suspicious emails
   - Report suspicious emails immediately

2. **Enhanced Verification**
   - Use multi-factor authentication for all systems
   - Verify any unusual requests via phone
   - Double-check all external communications

3. **Regular Training**
   - Complete monthly security awareness training
   - Stay updated on latest threat patterns
   - Practice incident response procedures

### For IT Administrators

```bash
# Example: Enhanced email filtering rules
# (This would be implemented by IT team)
if (sender_domain != official_domain &&
    content_contains("urgent", "compliance", "verify")) {
    quarantine_email();
    alert_security_team();
}
```

## Interactive Security Check

Test your knowledge with this quick security assessment:

<button onClick={() => {
  const answer = prompt("A customer emails asking you to transfer $50,000 urgently due to a 'family emergency.' What should you do first?");
  if (answer && answer.toLowerCase().includes("verify") || answer.toLowerCase().includes("call")) {
    alert("Correct! Always verify the customer's identity through official channels before processing any urgent requests.");
  } else {
    alert("Remember: Always verify customer identity through official channels (phone call to registered number) before processing urgent requests.");
  }
}}>
